How to use (GitHub Desktop):
1) Open your repo in Explorer (Repository → Show in Explorer).
2) Copy all files from this folder into your repo folder.
3) Commit and Push.
4) Visit your GitHub Pages URL in Safari on iPhone.
5) Share → Add to Home Screen.

Replace audio:
- Put your MP3 or WAV files in /audio/
- Open app.js in any editor and change the 'tracks' list to your filenames.
- Commit & Push again.

Notes:
- Paths are relative so it works on GitHub Pages project sites.
- First load requires internet; after that, it can work offline for cached files.
